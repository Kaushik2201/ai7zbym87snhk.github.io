# IE-Fresher Event Puzzle Website

This is the prototype for the IE-Fresher event puzzle bogus website

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/Cioraz/IE-FresherEvent
```
```
yarn
```
```
yarn run dev
```

## Working
* The header must be edited under components to add the IE logo and other stuff like website name
* The footer must be edited under components to add the required email address and make it a hyperlink
* The body currently has only text but images can be also added on the way to improve the looks

* The Body basically has some hidden links wherein if the mouse cursor is moved on it, it becomes a pointer enabling the user to click onto it, this will help the user to find the link to website B
* To make it trickier, I have added multiple links for multiple words under body so that the user must search through all those links to find the right one, else he can just view page source to find the link which makes it too easy :>


## Stuff we can upgrade
* Make all the links to some bit.ly prefix so that even if the user sees multiple links when viewing page source, the links wont display which is website B link.
